OpenWorldGen
============

A program that generates projections of randomly-generated planets. The user can specify various attributes of the world in advance such as average temperature, ocean coverage, and roughness. Runs a climate simulation to calculate the distribution of biomes on the planet. Returns an image of specified dimensions, format, and projection.

Notice:
The code I'm using is currently written in Python, but I'm translating it into R.


Climates
--------
To start with, this project will use the Koppen Climate Classification system.

Projections
-----------
These are relatively simple to work with. The most common to be used is probably Equirectangular with a 2x1 ratio of horizontal to vertical - allowing 3D rendering programs to easily map the image to a sphere. But to appease the politically correct factions of the worlds generated by this project, it will include projections such as Gall-Peters and Hobo-Dyer.
